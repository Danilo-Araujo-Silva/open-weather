# Open Weather

A simple application to find the weather of an city by
it's name.

It uses Open Weather API (for weather information) and
Geobytes API (for cities name suggestions).

Important note: there are some limitations concerning to
the APIs (for example the Geobytes API could not have
all cities in the world; Open Weather doesnt not recognize
non US characters very well).

This application also uses Create-React-App, React, Redux,
ImmutableJS and Yarn.

An example of the application running could be found here:

### Simple Installation

### Detailed Installation

#### Install NodeJS (Optional)
If you don't have NodeJS and NPM installed yet you can follow
[these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) in the
official documentation.

#### Install Latest NPM (Optional)
If you already have npm installed and you would like update it to the latest
version you can do it as follows:

- npm install npm@latest -g

#### Install Latest NodeJS (Optional)
If you already have npm installed and you would like to update the NodeJS to the
latest version you can do it as follows:

- sudo npm cache clean -f
- sudo npm install -g n

Important! The option `-f` is used to force clean the npm cache. Take care about it.
Anyway, I usually do this when I would like to install the latest NodeJS.
